4. **Input** data as prompted by the program
5. The program includes **input validation** and **error handling**

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Cases

#### Valid Input Testing
- Add records with valid data
- Perform all menu operations
- Verify expected outputs

#### Invalid Input Testing
- Test with negative numbers
- Test with out-of-range values
- Test with empty inputs
- Verify error messages appear

#### Edge Cases
- Test with empty data structures
- Test with maximum capacity
- Test boundary conditions

## 📊 Sample Run

The program provides a **menu-driven interface** with clear prompts and error messages for invalid inputs.


## 🛡️ Error Handling

The program includes comprehensive error handling:
- Try-catch blocks for all user inputs
- Input validation with meaningful error messages
- Graceful handling of exceptions

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
